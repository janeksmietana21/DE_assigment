# KommatiPara Data Engineering Project

This project is designed to process client data for the company KommatiPara, which deals with bitcoin trading. It involves collating two separate datasets containing client information and financial details.

## Background
The company wants to interface more effectively with their clients and start a new marketing push. They require a dataset that includes client emails from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, along with some financial details.

## Functionality
The application performs the following steps:
- Loads the client datasets using PySpark
- Filters the data to include only clients from the United Kingdom or the Netherlands
- Removes personal identifiable information, excluding emails
- Removes credit card numbers
- Joins the datasets using the ID field
- Renames columns for easier readability
- Saves the resulting dataset in the `client_data` directory

## Usage
To run the application, provide the paths to the dataset files and specify the countries to filter. Example command:


Make sure to have PySpark and the required dependencies installed before running the code.
